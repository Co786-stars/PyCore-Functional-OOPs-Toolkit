"""
# Explanation Module1 class : -
Its VVI to known how it's work (Module1):-
step1: Python read entire code but not yet execute before instantiation

step2: After execution of Model3 python execute try and inside that we
       create the instance from derived class(Module3).

step3: Now '__init__()' is auto initialize. after that 'super().__init__()'
       (
       Suppose we don't give the constructor.
       '__init__()' to child class what will be happen? ans -> interpreter
       try to find the '__init__()' to parents class and auto initialized
       ) 
       initialize the parents class '__init__()' and pass the value '11' 
       as argument from 'user'  to user parameter that assign in attribute 
       'usr_num'.

step4: 'user_num' value is accessible in derived class(child class) because it
       inherit property from Parents(Method3) now it's comes to calling function
       (super().__init__()) and return it's to calling method where 'obj' is created

step5: after that we invoke the 'digit_wise' method then python directly encounter 
       'digit_wise()' and in inside import the Library 'math' to using function log10(arg)
       to count how many times base 10 is multiplied to reached given number(self.usr_num). 

       Explanation log10(x)
       log10(1000) = log10(10^3) 
       This means: we need to raise the base (10) to the power of approximately 3 to produce the value 1000.
       That’s exactly what log10 does:
       # log₁₀(x) is the exponent to which the base 10 must be raised to produce the number x.

       -> log10 tells us how many times to multiply the base (10) to reach x
          So, here log10(11) So how many time multiply base (10) to reach 11 ?
          ans: single time 
              (how? because 10 needs to multiply only one time means 10^1 to reach 11)

          example : -
          log10(5)       ->  base need ?
          log10(10)      ->  base 10 need to multiply 1 time to reach x : 10^1 
          log10(1000000) ->  base 10 need to multiply 6 time to reach x : 10^6
          log10(1234567) ->  base 10 need to multiply 6 times to reach x : 10^6.somthing

          But Now in this statement we need to count digit of number that given by user. 
          suppose user enter number 1213421 how we can try to count -> 
          log10(1213421) means base 10 multiply at list approx 6 times 10^6 reach the 1213421.
          the exact value is in decimal 6.somthing to reach 1213421 . 
          Now to count the total digit of 1213421 we need to convert in integer and add 1
          so log10(x)+1 : 6.somthing+1 => int(log10(x))+1 --> 6+1 -> 7
          Now u see the total degit is 7 in given number : 1213421   

step6:   The self.usr_num attribute value is accessible because derived class access the super classes
         attributes now log(self.usr_num) means log10(11) that gives count digit of number in decimal
         we use int to get only integer so we get 1 why?(because base 10 needs only one time multiplication
         to reach approx at 11 : 10^1 = 10 but it a approx exactly in decimal) now we conver in int or add 1 to 
         get number of digit in user value

step7:   so num is store 2 after the define here via dry run:  
         for i in range(num //2): # num=2, itr=(0:num//2, 0:2//2) =  0:1, i = 0 exit
             left  = (self.usr_num // 10**(num-i-1))%10  # left = (11//10**(2-0-1)%10 -> (11//10)%10 -> 1%10 :: 1
             right = (self.usr_num // 10**i)%10 # right = (11//10**0)%10 -> (11//1)%10 --> 11%10 :: 1

step8:   according to condition if right and left digit are same then return the  this 'Is 11 Palindrome Yes : Tue'
         to calling method x.digit_wise()

step9:   print is display the returned value from module1 class.
         NOW when except is execute : In both cases of instance user send string or char value
                                      then except is execute at the place of attribute error that looks more 
                                      better in screen then error (red dotted spot)
