Operator overloading : -

In python method overloading is not directly supported  as it is in like some other 
language ex : - c++, Java etc mens python does not support method overloading

Method overloading is a concept where you can define multiple methods (or functions) 
with the same name but different parameter lists

why python does not support method overloading ? 

In Python, the flexibility of handling arbitrary arguments and keyword arguments—via *args and **kwargs—essentially fulfills the 
role of method overloading. Consequently, Python doesn't enforce traditional method overloading as some other languages do. 
If method are call with incorrect number of argument then error are occur at the runtime,  error name is type error
