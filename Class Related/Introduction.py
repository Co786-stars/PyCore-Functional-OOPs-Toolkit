# What is OOps 

"""
There are the three way to use python programming language  

1) whith the help of procedural programming 
2) with the help of Functional programming 
3) with the help of object-orianted programming


OOPs : -

Object is a discreate entity which have well define attribute and behaviour means every object have two property 
(a) Atributes  (b) Behaviours . 

Object oriented programming is a way of cording by creating class and object In this type of programming 
we mostly focse on data  as compare to  logic .  


Attribute : -
when we declare a variable within a class in oops it represent an attributes that hold information about the class
There are the two main attribute in python (a) instance attribute  (b) class attribute 

    (a) instance attribute
        The instance attribute are specific to each instance of a class and defined within the __init__() method of class 
        and accessing using self keyword 


    (b) class attribute
        The class attribute are shared across all instance of class and it defined outside the __init__() method directly 
        with class body  


Behaviours : -
when ever we declear a function it represent behaviour means when we perform any action it comes under the behaviour  
behavior refers to the actions that an object can perform, which are defined by its methods (functions within a class).

# Why OOps is important ?

"""
OOps is important because we creating more modular, maintainable, and scalable software
OOps is important because it provide many features like : -
a) class >> complete
b) object >> complete
c) Modularity
d) Reusability
e) Encapsulation >> Next
f) Inheritance >> complete
g) Polymorphism >> complete
h) Abstraction
i) Generalization
"""

# what is class / claffication

"""
Objects with common attributes and behavior are grouped together into a logical unit called a class, and the process is 
called classification

means that a class is a blueprint/templet/prototype that defines the common properties (attributes) and actions (behaviors) of a group of objects. 
the process of organizing these objects into classes based on their similarities is known as classification.

There are the two type of class user-define and Bulit-in  

Bulit-in class : -
Built- In class come with predefined attributes and methods. For example, classes like int, str, list, and dict are built-in classes.

User-define class : -
These are classes that you create yourself to suit the specific needs of your program
